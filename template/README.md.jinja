## Python and Tool Dependencies

Required:

- Python 3.11+

- Poetry 2.0+

The recommended way to do this on your local machine is with pyenv and pipx
(to bootstrap poetry):

For macOS:

```shell
brew update
brew install pyenv pipx
```

For Ubuntu:

```shell
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
apt install pipx
```

Now you can install a current Python and Poetry:

```shell
pyenv install 3.12.9  # Pick the version you want.
pipx install poetry
```
For Windows or other platforms, see the pyenv and poetry instructions.

## Getting Code

1. [Fork](https://github.com/jlevy/kmd/fork) this repo (having your own fork will make
   it easier to contribute).

2. [Check out](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
   the code.

3. Install the package dependencies:

   ```shell
   poetry install
   ```

## Development

```shell
# To run a shell within the Python environment:
